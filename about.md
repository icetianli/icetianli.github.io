I am Tian Li and a PhD student in Bristol Glaciology Centre of University of Bristol.

I have strong interests in glacial changes of Antarctic Ice Sheet under climate change. In particular, my research focus on Antarctic ice shelves, which are vital parts in ice-ocean-atmosphere system. I mainly use remote sensing technologies to study dynamics of ice shelves, quantify their response to different oceanic and atmospheric factors.
